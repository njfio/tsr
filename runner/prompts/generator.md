You're helping test a framework called the Theory of Sovereign Reflectivity (TSR). TSR reflects physics onto a "nonphysical" side using one rule. Your job is to apply the rule, exactly as written below, to ONE physics relation, and to report honestly where the result holds up and where it doesn't.

Ground rules:

- Use only the material in this prompt. Don't search the web. If you know anything else about TSR, set it aside, and say so in the `knew_tsr` field.
- Be strict, not generous. A reflection that reads as nonsense in TSR's own terms is a useful result. Don't rescue it with creative reinterpretation.
- The vocabulary below is frozen. If a physical term has no partner, list it in `unmapped_terms`; that does not change the shape. Any word you introduce goes in `new_words`. `shape` is the call the rule makes about the relationship (`keeps` or `turns around`); use `no partner` only when the reflection cannot be stated at all without a NEW word.
- Apply the rule as stated, even where you think it's wrong. Put your disagreement in `closing`, never in the reflection.
- Do not rewrite the formula. A relation that turns around keeps its formula in the table's terms; what turns is its reading (harder becomes easier, unreachable becomes already there).

## The rule

> "Keep each relationship, and flip the condition. Resistant becomes receptive, limited becomes limitless, radiating becomes collecting. ... Every term reflects; that part always happens. What you have to know is whether the relationship keeps its shape or turns around."

The deciding question: "One is an equivalence. The other is a cost that rises with resistance."

- Equivalences, definitions, identities, conservation laws and symmetries keep their shape.
- A cost or a limit caused by resistance turns around: what gets harder with more resistance gets easier with more receptivity. Mass is resistance, and distance is "what resistance makes." A separation made by distance also turns around.
- A statement with an odd number of such costs turns around; with none or an even number it keeps.
- "Units don't cross the mirror, only relationships do." Nothing on the nonphysical side has a number, a unit or a distance.

## Which quantities carry resistance (fixed before this run)

{resistance_rules}

## The frozen vocabulary

{vocab_table}

Words that must never appear on the nonphysical side: {forbidden}.

## Traps (refuse each one)

- No distance, time, location, travel or quantities on the nonphysical side.
- No resistance on the nonphysical side; it appears only as the gap.
- No entity properties (Awareness, Momentum as a property) on things that are not entities.
- "Nonphysical" does not mean "mental".
- Frequency is not a rate and not cycles per second.
- No sums where the book has products.
- No physical words in disguise: belief, expectation, will, effort, judgment, rank belong to the physical side.

## The relation

{relation}

## What to report

Return ONE JSON object with exactly these keys:

```json
{{
  "id": "{record_id}",
  "physical": "the relation as given",
  "reflected_formula": "the word-map image of the formula, in frozen words, with × ÷ and so on (empty if the relation has no formula)",
  "reflected_sentence": "one plain sentence",
  "shape": "keeps | turns around | no partner",
  "rule_reason": "equivalence or definition, or which cost or limit caused by resistance, or which separation",
  "rule_trace": ["which of these fired: identity, resistance-cost, separation, none"],
  "forced": true,
  "unmapped_terms": [],
  "new_words": [],
  "monotone_claims": [{{"rises": "a frozen word", "with": "a frozen word or 'alignment'", "sign": 1}}],
  "interpretation": "2 or 3 sentences, frozen words only",
  "conflicts": "any claim in the vocabulary table it contradicts, quoted, or \"none\"",
  "sense": 1,
  "confidence": 1,
  "closing": "one short paragraph: did the rule decide on its own, or did you need a judgment call? where was it ambiguous?",
  "knew_tsr": false
}}
```

`forced` is true only if the rule decided without a judgment call. `sense` 1–7 (1 = nonsense in TSR's terms; 7 = coherent and says something the table doesn't). `confidence` 1–7 on the keeps-or-turns call.
